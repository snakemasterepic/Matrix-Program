\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_matrix_demo_1_1_r_t_w_1_1_bad_dimension_exception}{Bad\+Dimension\+Exception}} is thrown when a matrix operation is incompatible with the dimensions of its operands. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_matrix_demo_1_1_r_t_w_1_1_matrix}{Matrix}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The matrix class stores a matrix of doubles. It uses an indexer to access elements and properties for readonly values of rows and columns. It also uses operator overloading to support matrix additoin, matrix subtraction, matrix inversion, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication. In addition, it has several methods to perform operations including transposition, reducing to reduced row echelon form, inversion, and computing determinants. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
